@title MQTT server for Erlang.
@doc 
<h3>Introduction</h3>
The server implements MQTT messaging protokol version 3.1.1 and allows communicate with MQTT clients to send/receive messages.
The server is written in Erlang. 
The server was tested with 
<ol>
<li>Mosquitto tools [https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_sub-1.html] and [https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_pub-1.html]</li>
<li>MQTT.fx client [http://www.mqttfx.org/]</li>
<li>Erlang MQTT client [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mqtt-client/]</li>
</ol>

<h3>Messenger implementation based on the MQTT server</h3>
Simple Instant messenger (SIM) [https://github.com/alekras/erl.web.sim] was created to test functionality of the MQQT server and prove good performance of the code.
Live demo of SIM is running here: [http://lucky3p.com/sim].

<h3>Architecture</h3>
MQTT server is an OTP application. Application depends on other Erlang applications: 
<ol>
<li>lager for logging services,</li>
<li>ranch for tcp and tsl connections,</li>
<li>msql_client for connection to MySQL server,</li>
<li>mqtt_common that is library keeping code that is common for client and server implementation</li>
</ol>
Session state data are storing in database (DETS or MySQL in current version)

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<h4>Installation</h4>
To start with the server you have to complete two steps below:
<ol>
<li>Install Erlang [http://www.erlang.org/download.html].</li>
<li>Install Rebar3 [https://www.rebar3.org/].</li>
</ol>

<h4>Building</h4>
<h5>Download or clone from SourceForge GIT repository</h5>
Download zip file erl.mqtt.server-vsn-1.0.{x}.zip from project files folder [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mqtt-server/files/versions-1.0.x/],
unzip it and rename unziped folder to erl.mqtt.server. This is an Eclipse project folder. You do not need to use Eclipse to build server but 
if you want you can use convenience of Eclipse and Erlide plugin.
<p>
Other way to get the server code is GIT. Type command
<pre>git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/mqtt-server/code erl.mqtt.server</pre>
</p>
<h5>Compiling</h5>
After you have got source code of the server then change directory to the erl.mqtt.server:
<pre>cd erl.mqtt.server</pre>
Run rebar3 for this project. You have to add path to rebar3 to OS PATH variable or just use the whole path:
<pre>/opt/local/bin/rebar3 compile</pre>
Rebar will fetch code of all dependencies and compile source files of main project and all dependencies.

<h4>Starting</h4>

To start server run bash script:
<pre>./start_mqtt_server.sh</pre>
Erlang shell will open and log statements are appering in console.

<h3>Testing</h3>

You can test the server with any MQTT client complained with protocol version 3.1.1.
I recommend to try Erlang MQTT client [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mqtt-client/].

<h4>Testing with Mosquitto tools</h4>
To test with Mosquitto tools you need to open two terminal windows. One for subscribing and other for publishing.
Open the first terminal windows and change directory to folder where Mosquitto is installed:
<pre>cd /usr/local/Cellar/mosquitto/1.4.10/</pre>
Now subscribe to "test/c" topic:
<pre>bin/mosquitto_sub -t test/c -p 18883 -i test -u guest -P guest -V mqttv311</pre>
<pre></pre>
Open the second terminal windows and change directory to Mosquitto installation:
<pre>cd /usr/local/Cellar/mosquitto/1.4.10/</pre>
Publish some message to "test/c" topic:
<pre>bin/mosquitto_pub -t test/c -p 18883 -i test1 -u guest -P guest -m "Test message from mosquitto tools QoS=2" -q 2 -V mqttv311</pre>
In first terminal you will see incoming message:
<pre>Test message from mosquitto tools QoS=2</pre>

<h4>Testing with other MQTT clients</h4>
The server was tested with other clients:
<ol>
<li>Websocket MQTT client from HiveMQ [http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/].</li>
<li>MQTT.fx client [http://www.mqttfx.org/].</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To set up ports for TCP and TSL socket connection go to mqtt.config. This is OTP application configuration file contained startup data for
lager, ranch and mqtt server configuration.

<h4>Add/Remove users</h4>

The MQTT server is distributed with preset user dets db. Users are guest/guest and admin/admin.
To add other users run Erlang shell:
<pre>erl -pa _build/default/lib/*/ebin</pre>
and issue command:
<pre>1&gt;mqtt_server:add_user("UserName", &lt;&lt;"UserPassword"&gt;&gt;).</pre>
or for user delete:
<pre>1&gt;mqtt_server:remove_user("UserName").</pre>
